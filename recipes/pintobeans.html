    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Me gustan los frijoles pintos. Nunca los ha cocinado pero si los ha comido.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups dry pinto beans</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon avocado oil</li>
        <li>1/2 white onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons cumin</li>
        <li>8 cups water, more as needed</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon oregano</li>
        <li>2 teaspooons fine sea salt, more to taste</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lime juice, more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>First, soak the beans. Place them in a large colander and sift through them to remove any stones or
                debris. Rinse them well and transfer them to a large bowl. Cover them with 2-3 inches of water and set
                them aside to soak for at least 8 hours, or overnight.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The next day, cook the aromatics. Sauté half an onion in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat (you
                could also toss in a jalapeño if you like your beans spicy!). When the onion softens, stir in cumin, the
                soaked, drained beans, water, oregano, salt, and pepper.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Then, simmer. The cooking time will depend on the freshness of your beans and how you like them cooked. I
                cook my pinto beans until they're falling apart and the liquid around them has thickened. I start
                checking after an hour and again every 15 minutes after that.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Finally, season to taste. When the beans are cooked to your liking, season them with a squeeze of lime
                juice, more salt and pepper, and chili powder to taste.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
